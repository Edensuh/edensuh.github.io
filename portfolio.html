                <h2>Audio doc: Eden Suh explores Northern Ontario's exceedingly high rate of tinnitus</h2>
                <p>This story was a part of my Master's Research Project that I did for my degree. I explored the higher rates of tinnitus in Northern Ontario and how it may mentally affect people with the condition.</p>
                <p>I did the scripting, recording, interviews and editing (everything).</p>

                <h2>Video: Alex Trebek makes a permanent mark on Sudbury Secondary</h2>
                <p>I had the opportunity to interview Montreal artist Kevin Ledo on a large portrait mural he did in memory of the late game show host and Sudbury native, Alex Trebek.</p>
                <p>I did the scripting, VO, shooting, and editing for this video (everything).</p>

                <h2>Video: Pitter-patter, let's get at 'er: Letterkenny gifts outdoor gym to the Nickel City</h2>
                <p>This was a story on the grand opening of Pitter Patter Park here in Sudbury. I was initially sent to cover the event of the opening ceremony but after everyone had left, I saw an opportunity to film people actually using the outdoor gym. I quickly asked the young adults if they would be interested in being in a video and they gave me the greenlight.</p>

                <h2>Video: Sudbury Burlesque excited to hit the stage this weekend</h2>
                <p>I took inspiration from the Vogue 'get ready with me' videos. I wanted to try something different and I had a lot of fun filming it. This is a video I did for an upcoming burlesque show and I had the chance to interview one of the performers.</p>
                <p>I did the scripting, shooting, and editing for this video (everything).</p>

                <h2>Communities Eat: Finding traditional Japanese food in Sudbury</h2>
                <p>This story is an example of a TikTok I did to feature a new Japanese restaurant in Sudbury. I was going to do a written story anyways but I thought it would be fun to get some reactions from my coworkers for a TikTok. The food was also way too pretty to not capture on video.</p>
                <p>I filmed and edited the video (everything).</p>
